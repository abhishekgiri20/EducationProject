                <h3>Learn Python In The Easiest Way</h3>
                <p>
                <h3>What is Python?</h3>
                Python is a high-level, general-purpose, and very popular programming language. Python programming
                language (latest Python 3) is being used in web development, Machine Learning applications, along with
                all cutting-edge technology in Software Industry.<br>

                Python language is being used by almost all tech-giant companies like – Google, Amazon, Facebook,
                Instagram, Dropbox, Uber… etc.<br>

                The biggest strength of Python is huge collection of standard library which can be used for the
                following:<br><br>
                Machine Learning<br>
                GUI Applications (like Kivy, Tkinter, PyQt etc. )<br>
                Web frameworks like Django (used by YouTube, Instagram, Dropbox)<br>
                Image processing (like OpenCV, Pillow)<br>
                Web scraping (like Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium)<br>
                Test frameworks<br>
                Multimedia<br>
                Scientific computing<br>
                Text processing and many more..<br>

                <h3>Why Learn Python?</h3>
                Python is currently the most widely used multi-purpose, high-level programming language, which allows
                programming in Object-Oriented and Procedural paradigms. Python programs generally are smaller than
                other programming languages like Java. Programmers have to type relatively less and the indentation
                requirement of the language, makes them readable all the time.<br>

                <h3>Introduction To PYTHON</h3> Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming
                language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software
                Foundation. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to
                express their concepts in fewer lines of code.<br>
                <h3>Reason for increasing popularity</h3>
                (i) Emphasis on code readability, shorter codes, ease of writing<br>
                (ii)Programmers can express logical concepts in fewer lines of code in comparison to languages such as
                C++ or Java.<br>
                (iii)Python supports multiple programming paradigms, like object-oriented, imperative and functional
                programming or procedural.<br>
                (iv)There exists inbuilt functions for almost all of the frequently used concepts.<br>
                (v)Philosophy is “Simplicity is the best”.<br>

                <h3>LANGUAGE FEATURES</h3><br><br>
                <h3>(i)Interpreted</h3>
                There are no separate compilation and execution steps like C and C++.
                Directly run the program from the source code.
                Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecodes which is then
                translated into native language of specific computer to run it.
                No need to worry about linking and loading with libraries, etc.
                <h3>(ii)Platform Independent</h3>
                Python programs can be developed and executed on multiple operating system platforms.
                Python can be used on Linux, Windows, Macintosh, Solaris and many more.
                Free and Open Source; Redistributable
                <h3>(iii)High-level Language</h3>
                In Python, no need to take care about low-level details such as managing the memory used by the program.
                <h3>(iv)Simple
                </h3>
                Closer to English language;Easy to Learn<br>
                More emphasis on the solution to the problem rather than the syntax<br>
                <h3>(v)Embeddable</h3>
                Python can be used within C/C++ program to give scripting capabilities for the program’s users.
                <h3>(vi) Robust:</h3>
                Exceptional handling features<br>
                Memory management techniques in built<br><br>
                <h3>Advantages :</h3>
                1. Presence of third-party modules<br>
                2. Extensive support libraries(NumPy for numerical calculations, Pandas for data analytics etc)<br>
                3. Open source and community development<br>
                4. Versatile, Easy to read, learn and write<br>
                5. User-friendly data structures<br>
                6. High-level language<br>
                7. Dynamically typed language(No need to mention data type based on the value assigned, it takes data
                type)<br>
                8. Object-oriented language<br>
                9. Portable and Interactive<br>
                10. Ideal for prototypes – provide more functionality with less coding<br><Br>
               <h3>Applications :</h3> 
                1. GUI based desktop applications<br>
                2. Graphic design, image processing applications, Games, and Scientific/ computational Applications
                3. Web frameworks and applications<br>
                4. Enterprise and Business applications<br>
                5. Operating Systems<br>
                6. Education<br>
               7. Database Access<br>
                8. Language Development<br>
               9. Prototyping<br>
