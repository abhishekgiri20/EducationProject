        <h3>Learn JavaScript In The Easiest Way</h3>
        <p>
        <h3>Introduction to JavaScript</h3>
        JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted compiled programming language which is also known
        as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser
        environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side
        developments. Javascript is both imperative and declarative type of language. JavaScript contains a standard
        library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control
        structures, and statements. <br><br>

        <h3>Client-side:</h3> It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). Like if
        client-side
        extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
        clicks, form input, and page navigation. Useful libraries for the client-side are AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS and
        so many others.
        <h3>Server-side:</h3> It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. Like if the server-side
        extensions
        allow an application to communicate with a database, and provide continuity of information from one invocation
        to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. The useful framework which is the most
        famous these days is node.js.
        <h3>Imperative language –</h3> In this type of language we are mostly concern about how it is to be done . It
        simply
        control the flow of computation . The procedural programming approach , object, oriented approach comes under
        this like async await we are thinking what it is to be done further after async call.
        <h3>Declarative programming – </h3> In this type of language we are concern about how it is to be done ,
        basically here
        logical computation require . Here main goal is to describe the desired result without direct dictation on how
        to get it like arrow function do .


        JavaScript can be added to your HTML file in two ways:

          <h3>Internal JS:</h3> We can add JavaScript directly to our HTML file by writing the code inside the (script
          )tag. The (script) tag can either be placed inside the (head) or the (body) tag according to the requirement.
          <h3> External JS:</h3> We can write JavaScript code in other file having an extension.js and then link this
          file inside the (head) tag of the HTML file in which we want to add this code.<br><br>
          <h3>History of JavaScript:</h3> It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was an engineer at Netscape.
          It was
          originally going to be named LiveScript but was renamed. Unlike most programming languages, the JavaScript
          language has no concept of input or output. It is designed to run as a scripting language in a host
          environment,
          and it is up to the host environment to provide mechanisms for communicating with the outside world. The most
          common host environment is the browser.<br><br>

          <h3>Features of JavaScript:</h3> According to a recent survey conducted by Stack Overflow, JavaScript is the
          most popular language on earth.
          With advances in browser technology and JavaScript having moved into the server with Node.js and other
          frameworks, JavaScript is capable of so much more. Here are a few things that we can do with JavaScript:<br>

         (i) JavaScript was created in the first place for DOM manipulation. Earlier websites were mostly static, after JS
          was created dynamic Web sites were made.<br>
         (ii) Functions in JS are objects. They may have properties and methods just like another object. They can be passed
          as arguments in other functions.<br>
          (iii)Can handle date and time.<br>
         (iv) Performs Form Validation although the forms are created using HTML.
          No compiler is needed.
         <h3>Applications of JavaScript:</h3> 

         <h3></h3> Web Development: Adding interactivity and behavior to static sites JavaScript was invented to do this in 1995.
          By using AngularJS that can be achieved so easily.
         <h3></h3> Web Applications: With technology, browsers have improved to the extent that a language was required to create
          robust web applications. When we explore a map in Google Maps then we only need to click and drag the mouse.
          All detailed view is just a click away, and this is possible only because of JavaScript. It uses Application
          Programming Interfaces(APIs) that provide extra power to the code. The Electron and React is helpful in this
          department.
          <h3>Server Applications:</h3> With the help of Node.js, JavaScript made its way from client to server and node.js is
          the most powerful on the server-side.
         <h3>Games:</h3>  Not only in websites, but JavaScript also helps in creating games for leisure. The combination of
          JavaScript and HTML 5 makes JavaScript popular in game development as well. It provides the EaseJS library
          which provides solutions for working with rich graphics.
          <h3>Smartwatches: </h3>JavaScript is being used in all possible devices and applications. It provides a library
          PebbleJS which is used in smartwatch applications. This framework works for applications that require the
          internet for its functioning.
          <h3>Art:</h3> Artists and designers can create whatever they want using JavaScript to draw on HTML 5 canvas, and make
          the sound more effective also can be used p5.js library.
          <h3>Machine Learning:</h3> This JavaScript ml5.js library can be used in web development by using machine learning.
