                <h3>Learn JAVA In The Easiest Way</h3>
                <p>
                <h3>What is Java?</h3>
                Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure
                programming language.<br>

                Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. James
                Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a
                registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.<br>

                <h3>Introduction to Java</h3>
                Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few
                implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, and
                run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without
                the need for recompilation. Java was first released in 1995 and is widely used for developing
                applications for desktop, web, and mobile devices. Java is known for its simplicity, robustness, and
                security features, making it a popular choice for enterprise-level applications.<br><br>
                <h3>Primary/Main Features of Java</h3>
                <h3> 1. Platform Independent:</h3> Compiler converts source code to bytecode and then the JVM executes
                the
                bytecode generated by the compiler. This bytecode can run on any platform be it Windows, Linux, or macOS
                which means if we compile a program on Windows, then we can run it on Linux and vice versa. Each
                operating system has a different JVM, but the output produced by all the OS is the same after the
                execution of the bytecode. That is why we call java a platform-independent language.

                <h3>2. Object-Oriented Programming Language:</h3> Organizing the program in the terms of a collection of
                objects
                is a way of object-oriented programming, each of which represents an instance of the class.<br>

                The four main concepts of Object-Oriented programming are:<br>

                Abstraction<br>
                Encapsulation<br>
                Inheritance<br>
                Polymorphism<br>
                <h3>3. Simple:</h3> Java is one of the simple languages as it does not have complex features like
                pointers,
                operator overloading, multiple inheritances, and Explicit memory allocation.<br>

                <h3>4. Robust: </h3> Java language is robust which means reliable. It is developed in such a way that it
                puts a
                lot of effort into checking errors as early as possible, that is why the java compiler is able to detect
                even those errors that are not easy to detect by another programming language. The main features of java
                that make it robust are garbage collection, Exception Handling, and memory allocation.<br>

                <h3>5. Secure:</h3> 5. Secure: In java, we don’t have pointers, so we cannot access out-of-bound arrays
                i.e it shows
                ArrayIndexOutOfBound Exception if we try to do so. That’s why several security flaws like stack
                corruption or buffer overflow are impossible to exploit in Java. Also, java programs run in an
                environment that is independent of the os(operating system) environment which makes java programs more
                secure.<br>

                <h3>6. Distributed:</h3> We can create distributed applications using the java programming language.
                Remote
                Method Invocation and Enterprise Java Beans are used for creating distributed applications in java. The
                java programs can be easily distributed on one or more systems that are connected to each other through
                an internet connection.<br>

                <h3>7. Multithreading:</h3> Java supports multithreading. It is a Java feature that allows concurrent
                execution
                of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of the CPU.<br>

                <h3> 8. Portable:</h3>As we know, java code written on one machine can be run on another machine. The
                platform-independent feature of java in which its platform-independent bytecode can be taken to any
                platform for execution makes java portable.<br>

                <h3> 9. High Performance: </h3>Java architecture is defined in such a way that it reduces overhead
                during the
                runtime and at some times java uses Just In Time (JIT) compiler where the compiler compiles code
                on-demand basics where it only compiles those methods that are called making applications to execute
                faster.<br>

                <h3>10. Dynamic flexibility:</h3> Java being completely object-oriented gives us the flexibility to add
                classes,
                new methods to existing classes, and even create new classes through sub-classes. Java even supports
                functions written in other languages such as C, C++ which are referred to as native methods.<br><br>
                <h3>Advantages of Java:</h3>
                <h3>1. Platform independent:</h3> Java code can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine
                (JVM) installed,
                which means that applications can be written once and run on any device.
                <h3>2. Object-Oriented:</h3> Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it
                follows the
                principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
                <h3>3. Security:</h3>Java has built-in security features that make it a secure platform for developing
                applications, such as automatic memory management and type checking.
                <h3>4. Large community: </h3> Java has a large and active community of developers, which means that
                there is a lot of
                support available for learning and using the language.<br><br>
                <h3>Disadvantages of Java:</h3>
                <h3>1. Performance:</h3> Java can be slower compared to other programming languages, such as C++, due to its use of
                a virtual machine and automatic memory management.<br>
               <h3>2. Memory management:</h3>  Java’s automatic memory management can lead to slower performance and increased
                memory usage, which can be a drawback for some applications.<br>
