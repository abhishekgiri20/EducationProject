        <h3>Learn HTML & CSS In The Easiest Way</h3>
        <p>
        <h3>What is HTML ?</h3>
        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using the markup language. HTML is the
        combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages and markup
        language defines the text document within the tag that define the structure of web pages. <br><br>
        <h3>What is HTML used for ?</h3>
        HTML is used to create the structure of web pages that are displayed on the World Wide Web (www). It contains
        Tags and Attributes that are used to design the web pages. Also, we can link multiple pages using Hyperlinks.
        <br><br>
        

        <h3> HTML Basic Format Page Structure</h3>
        The basic structure of an HTML page is laid out below. It contains the essential building-block elements (i.e.
        doctype declaration, HTML, head, title, and body elements) upon which all web pages are created.<br><br>
        The parts of the basic html is given below -

        <h3>!doctype html</h3> – A doctype or document type declaration is an instruction that tells the web browser
        about the
        markup language in which the current page is written. It is not an element or tag. The doctype declaration is
        not case-sensitive.

        <h3>html</h3> – This tag is used to define the root element of HTML document. This tag tells the browser that it
        is
        an HTML document. It is the second outer container element that contains all other elements within it.

        <h3>head</h3> – This tag is used to define the head portion of the HTML document that contains information
        related to
        the document. Elements within the head tag are not visible on the front-end of a webpage.

        <h3>body</h3> – The body tag is used to enclose all the visible content of a webpage. In other words, the body
        content is what the browser will show on the front end.<br>
        <h3>HTML Elements</h3>
        In this article, we will know the HTML Elements, along with understanding the various available elements & their
        syntax through the examples. An HTML element is the collection of start and end tags with the content inserted
        in between them.<br><br>

        HTML Element: The HTML element consist of 3 parts.<br>
        i) Opening tag: It is used to tell the browser where the content material starts.<br>
        ii)Closing tag: It is used to tell the browser where the content material ends.<br>

        iii)Content: It is the actual content material inside the opening and closing tag.<br><br>

        <h3>Empty HTML Elements:</h3> HTML Elements without any content i.e, that do not print anything are called Empty
        elements. Empty HTML elements do not have an ending tag. For instance. break tag(br),
        horizontal tag(hr),link tag(link), input tag(input) etc are HTML elements.<br><br>
        <h3>HTML Heading</h3>
        In this article, we will know HTML Headings, & their implementation through examples. An HTML heading tag is
        used to define the headings of a page. There are six levels of headings defined by HTML. These 6 heading
        elements are h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6; with h1 being the highest level and h6 being the least.<br />
        <ul>
          <li> h1. is used for the main heading. (Biggest in size)</li>
          <li> h2. is used for subheadings, if there are further sections under the subheadings then the
            h3. elements are used.</li>
          <li> h6 for the small heading (smallest one).</li>
        </ul>
        Browsers display the contents of headings in different sizes. The exact size at which each browser shows
        the heading can vary slightly. Users can also adjust the size of the text in their browser.<br><br>

        Syntax:

        // the 'h' inside the tag should be in small case only.<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Heading1</li>
          <li>Heading2</li>
          .
          .
          .
          <li>Heading6</li>
        </ul><br>

        <h3>CSS</h3>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to apply styles to web pages. Cascading Style Sheets are fondly referred to
        as CSS. It is used to make web pages presentable. The reason for using this is to simplify the process of making
        web pages presentable. It allows you to apply styles on web pages. More importantly, it enables you to do this
        independently of the HTML that makes up each web page.
        <h3>Why we learn CSS?</h3>
        Styling is an essential property for any website. It increases the standards and overall look of the website
        that makes it easier for the user to interact with it. A website can be made without CSS, as styling is MUST
        since no user would want to interact with a dull and shabby website. So for knowing Web Development, learning
        CSS is mandatory.<br><br>
        There are three types of CSS which are given below:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Inline: Inline CSS contains the CSS property in the body section attached with the element known as inline
            CSS.</li>
          <li> Internal or Embedded: The CSS ruleset should be within the HTML file in the head section i.e the CSS is
            embedded
            within the HTML file.</li>
          <li>External: External CSS contains a separate CSS file that contains only style property with the help of tag
            attributes.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3> What does CSS mean?</h3>
        Tags for formatting a web page were never intended in HTML. HTML was established to define a web page’s content.
        The addition of tags like font and color attributes to HTML created a big problem for web developers. The
        creation of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to each page, became a time-consuming
        and costly procedure. CSS was established to address this issue. CSS eliminated the HTML page’s style
        formatting.
        <h3>How CSS is different from HTML?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is used to define a structure of a web page whereas CSS is used to style the web pages by using
            different styling features.</li>
          <li>HTML consists of tags inside which text is enclosed and CSS consists of selectors and declaration blocks.
          </li>
          <li>
            CSS can be internal or external depending upon the requirement.</li>
          <li>We cannot use HTML inside a CSS sheet but we can use CSS inside an HTML document.
          </li>
          <li>CSS has comparatively higher backup and support than HTML.</li>
        </ul>
