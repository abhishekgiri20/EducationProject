        <h3>Learn VUE.JS In The Easiest Way</h3>
        <p>
        <h3>What is VUE.JS</h3>
        Vue.js is an open-source progressive JavaScript framework used to develop interactive web user interfaces and
        single-page applications. Vue.js is mainly focused on the view part of the application that is also called
        front end development.<br>
        Vue.js is going popular day by day because it is very easy to integrate with other projects and libraries. It
        is very simple to install and use. Even beginners can understand it easily and start building their own user
        interfaces.<br><br>
        <h3>The Progressive Framework</h3>
        Vue is a framework and ecosystem that covers most of the common features needed in frontend development. But the
        web is extremely diverse - the things we build on the web may vary drastically in form and scale. With that in
        mind, Vue is designed to be flexible and incrementally adoptable. Depending on your use case, Vue can be used in
        different ways:<br>

        (i) Enhancing static HTML without a build step<br>
        (ii)Embedding as Web Components on any page<br>
        (iii)Single-Page Application (SPA)<br>
        (iv)Fullstack / Server-Side Rendering (SSR)<br>
        (v) Jamstack / Static Site Generation (SSG)<br>
        (vi)Targeting desktop, mobile, WebGL, and even the terminal<br>
        If you find these concepts intimidating, don't worry! The tutorial and guide only require basic HTML and
        JavaScript knowledge, and you should be able to follow along without being an expert in any of these.<br><br>

        If you are an experienced developer interested in how to best integrate Vue into your stack, or you are curious
        about what these terms mean, we discuss them in more detail in Ways of Using Vue.<br>

        Despite the flexibility, the core knowledge about how Vue works is shared across all these use cases. Even if
        you are just a beginner now, the knowledge gained along the way will stay useful as you grow to tackle more
        ambitious goals in the future. If you are a veteran, you can pick the optimal way to leverage Vue based on the
        problems you are trying to solve, while retaining the same productivity. This is why we call Vue "The
        Progressive Framework": it's a framework that can grow with you and adapt to your needs.
